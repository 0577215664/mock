Release checklist overview:

  1) update changlelog
  2) check all changes into git and push upstream
  3) properly tag git tree with signature
  4) check release into fedora cvs
  5) do build for -devel
  6) do build for F-7, push to testing, then stable
  7) do a build for FC-6


In the mock git tree, first ensure that you are:
  --> on the master branch (or correct branch per branching guidelines)
  --> updated changelog
  --> fully-up-to-date wrt official tree
  --> have no local changes that havent been pushed
  --> test build rpm
  --> tag build and push tag

  $ git status
  # On branch master
  nothing to commit (working directory clean)

  $ git pull
  Already up-to-date.

  $ git diff origin

  $ make rpm
    ...

  $ git tag -s mock-$VERSION


In the fedora CVS tree:
  --> update CVS to latest
  --> upload new source tarball
  --> merge in spec changes
  --> ensure good changelog

  $ cd fedora/mock
  $ cvs up

  $ cd devel
  $ make new-sources FILES=~/git/mock/mock-0.7.5.tar.gz 
  $ cp ~/git/mock/mock.spec .
  $ cvs diff mock.spec
     --> if spec was changed outside of git directly in fedora cvs, fixup and merge changes in, add changes back to git
     --> if there is no changelog entry, do one now.
  $ make clog
  $ cvs commit -F clog
  $ make tag
  $ make build

  $ cd ../F-7
  $ make new-sources FILES=~/git/mock/mock-0.7.5.tar.gz 
  $ cp ~/git/mock/mock.spec .
  $ cvs diff mock.spec
     --> if spec was changed outside of git directly in fedora cvs, fixup and merge changes in, add changes back to git
     --> if there is no changelog entry, do one now.
  $ make clog
  $ cvs commit -F clog
  $ make tag
  $ make build
 
# in Bodhi
  --> create a proposed update for F7
  --> push to testing
  --> wait for email saying it has been two weeks and would be a good time to push to stable. :)
  --> push to stable

# in fedora CVS tree:
  --> update F6 (try to ensure that we do F7/devel upgrades first to not break upgrade paths.)

  $ cd fedora/mock
  $ cvs up

  $ cd ../FC-6
  $ make new-sources FILES=~/git/mock/mock-0.7.5.tar.gz 
  $ cp ~/git/mock/mock.spec .
  $ cvs diff mock.spec
     --> if spec was changed outside of git directly in fedora cvs, fixup and merge changes in, add changes back to git
     --> if there is no changelog entry, do one now.
  $ make clog
  $ cvs commit -F clog
  $ make tag
  $ make build
