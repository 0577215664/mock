In the fedora CVS tree:
  --> update CVS to latest
  --> upload new source tarball
  --> merge in spec changes
  --> ensure good changelog

  $ cd fedora/mock
  $ cvs up

  $ cd devel
  $ make new-sources FILES=~/git/mock/mock-0.7.5.tar.gz 
  $ cp ~/git/mock/mock.spec .
  $ cvs diff mock.spec
     --> if spec was changed outside of git directly in fedora cvs, fixup and merge changes in, add changes back to git
     --> if there is no changelog entry, do one now.
  $ make clog
  $ cvs commit -F clog
  $ make tag
  $ make build

  $ cd ../F-7

# in Bodhi
  --> create a proposed update for F7
  --> push to testing
  --> wait for email saying it has been two weeks and would be a good time to push to stable. :)
  --> push to stable

# in fedora CVS tree:
  --> update F6 (try to ensure that we do F7/devel upgrades first to not break upgrade paths.)
