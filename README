Mock Readme
Mock is a simple chroot/rpm building program. It doesn't do anything
terribly fancy other than build a single srpm at a time in a chroot.

You invoke mock using one of the following forms:

   mock [options] [rebuild] /path/to/srpm(s)
   mock [options] chroot <cmd>
   mock [options] {init|clean|shell}

options:
  -r CHROOT             chroot name/config file name default: chroot.cfg
  --no-clean            do not clean chroot before building
  --arch=ARCH           target build arch
  --debug               Output copious debugging information
  --resultdir=RESDIR	path for resulting files to be put
  --statedir=STATEDIR   path for state file is written
  --uniqueext=UNIQUEEXT Arbitrary, unique extension to append to buildroot
                        directory name
  --configdir=CONFIGDIR Change directory where config files are found
  --quiet		Suppress most output
  --autocache		Turn on build-root caching
  --rebuildcache	Force rebuild of build-root cache
  --help		Show usage information and exit
  --version		Show version number and exit

 commands:
  init   - initialize a chroot (install pkgs, setup devices, etc,) then exit
  chroot - run the specified command in an (already initialized) chroot
  clean  - purge the chroot tree - normally this happens right before a build
          but this is for the tidy-minded
  shell  - start an interactive shell in the specified chroot
  rebuild <srpm> - for mach compatibility

mock does:
- builds the chroot
- takes the srpm, rebuilds into another srpm
   - it does this to make sure that the build deps in the spec file are
     made in the right environment.
- takes the build deps from the new srpm and installs them.
- rebuilds the new srpm into binary packages
- copies the binary packages into the result dir
- logs nicely so that chroot creation and build logs are separate
- outputs little unless it needs to.
