# Work in progress...

A note on mock versions: 

  There are now two main branches to be aware of:
  	- mock-1.0 (pre-F13 and EPEL5)
	- master (for releasing F-13+ and EPEL6+)
    - devel (for development of future versions)
  In the upstream git tree, mock-1.0 is tracked on the branch origin/mock-1.0,
  while mock-1.1+ is in the master branch. Please be careful when
  updating the various distro to use the correct branch and version
  number when generating tarfiles for RPM generation.

Note that we've now switched over to using git for the package
repositories (as opposed to the old CVS repositories). To make use of
the new format, you must install the fedora-packager package and clone
the mock package repository:

    $ sudo yum install fedora-packager
    $ fedpkg clone mock
    $ mv mock mock-fedora.git

The last step is not strictly required, but I do it to keep from
confusing the package repository with the upstream (source) repository

=====================================================================

Release checklist overview:

0) change to the local master
   $ git checkout master
1) fetch git remotes and fast-forward your local master
   $ git pull --rebase master
2) merge any remote updates for specific fixes
   $ git merge origin/devel
3) install snapshot version
   $ tito build --rpm -i
4) run 'make check' and fix any reported failures until it passes
   $ make check
5) tag the git tree:
   $ tito tag
6) push to main git repo (only from master branch):
   $ git push
   $ git push --tags
7) copy tarball to fedorahosted:
   $ tito build --tgz
   $ scp mock-<version>.tar.gz fedorahosted.org:/srv/web/releases/m/o/mock/
8) merge changes back to devel branch
   $ git checkout devel
   $ git merge origin/master
9) release for EPEL and Fedora
   $ git checkout master
   # make sure that .tito/releasers.conf is up to date
   $ tito release fedora-git-all
   $ tito release epel-git-all

Once the builds finish (successfully) you should push the just built
packages to their respective testing repositories. This can be done
either with the Bodhi WebUI at
https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/ or if there are no other
package dependencies, using the 'fedpkg update' command. 
Note that you do not need to do this for the master (rawhide) branch
since it automatically gets pushed to testing.
