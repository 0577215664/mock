Mock Readme
Mock is a simple chroot/rpm building program. It doesn't do anything
terribly fancy other than build a single srpm at a time in a chroot.

You invoke it as:
mock -r name-of-chroot /path/to/srpm

options:
  -r CHROOT             chroot name/config file name default: chroot.cfg
  --no-clean            do not clean chroot before building
  --arch=ARCH           target build arch
  --debug               Output copious debugging information
  --resultdir=RESULTDIR
                        path for resulting files to be put

mock does:
- builds the chroot
- takes the srpm, rebuilds into another srpm
   - it does this to make sure that the build deps in the spec file are
     made in the right environment.
- takes the build deps from the new srpm and installs them.
- rebuilds the new srpm into binary packages
- copies the binary packages into the result dir
- logs nicely so that chroot creation and build logs are separate
- outputs little unless it needs to.
